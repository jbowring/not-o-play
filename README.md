# not-o-play
Extension for Safari to automatically disable auto-play on YouTube.

Do you get annoyed that YouTube keeps re-enabling auto-play every few 
days? Open this extension in Xcode, add it to Safari, and be auto-play 
free forever!

This is a 'dumb' implementation: after loading any YouTube watch page, this extension activates the auto-play toggle. If you manually enable auto-play on a video, this extension will override it again and turn it off when you navigate to another video.
